        <p>Warm wishes,</p>
The sessions with our senior, K Vishal Varma [CB.EN.U4CSE18334] were very helpful. He spent his great time, explaining us flowgramming.  He had immense patience to explain the concepts and clear our doubts even if they were repetitive and simple. He made sure the basics of flowgramming were clear without any ambiguity.
He also came up with a set of problems with different difficulty levels for better understanding of the students. We are thankful for having him in our classes and we hope this continues in the future. 
<p>Thank you</p>
